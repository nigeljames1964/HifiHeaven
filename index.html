                                stage. The four independent channels are fed by dual double-wound toroidal transformers with double rectification and four independent regulators which constitute a true “dual-mono” architecture. The input and output XLR
                                jacks are Swiss-made locking Neutrik for superior conductivity and durability. The input RCA jacks are premium American CMC and the 6.35mm output headphone port is also a locking Neutrik jack. The volume control is a Japanese
                                ALPS potentiometer for exceptional tracking and smooth rotation. Premium hand-selected resistors are used throughout the circuit alongside German WIMA / CHEMI-COM capacitors. The Little Dot MK VII+ is an OCL (output capacitor-less)
                                design which provides an unmatched level of sound purity as components in the signal path are minimized to reduce distortion and imparting color to the sound. Extremely low output impedance and high damping factor coupled
                                with immense power output ensures iron control of any headphone driver. The Little Dot MK VII+ delivers an unmatched level of transparency with unbound dynamic range, lightening quick transient response, and thunderous
                                low frequency impact.

                        Every Naim product is conceived, designed and engineered entirely in service of the sound, revealing a pure experience of music that is as close as possible to its original live source. We believe that the exploration of sound is an adventure that rewards
                        you with a clarity and connection that becomes more powerful the deeper you travel within it. Which is why, every element within our systems is crafted to create a silence around the sound, reducing any interference between you
                        and the intention of the artist. We achieve this through tireless attention to four fundamentals in our engineering:<br> 1. Space - We give each of the critical components their own environment, omitting
                        outside or ‘toxic’ interference, which means no compromise on the purity of sound.<br> 2. Circuitry - We minimise any interplay between the internal levels, so that you can simultaneously enjoy both the quiet and the loud, as originally
                        intended.
                        <br> 3. Purposeful materiality - We use materials that excel in performance, not just appearance.<br> 4. Technology - We constantly strive for new and innovative ways to achieve our goals, integrating sophisticated electronic design
                        and software development, with mechanical engineering and acoustics to deliver a truly advanced sonic experience.

                    <div class="info">
                        <p>It’s been almost 30 years since we designed our first integrated amplifier: time enough to define and refine the technical ingredients essential to high-end performance. Our reference quality SUPERNAIT 2 represents the pinnacle
                            of this accumulated knowledge. It is both the most sophisticated integrated amplifier we’ve ever created and a classic Naim Audio product, shot through with the soul of the original, iconic NAIT. SUPERNAIT 2 includes a Class
                            A preamp output stage which doubles as a headphone amplifier, ceramic heatsink technology that minimises capacitive coupling between the chassis and output transistors for optimum sound quality. Its inputs are each individually
                            decoupled and hand-wired to minimise noise and interference while internal switching employs ultra-low-noise, constant current sources which are derived directly from the electronic design of the flagship NAC 552 preamplifier.
                            Set at the core of every SUPERNAIT 2 is a custom-designed toroidal transformer featuring seven separate windings. This can be further upgraded with one of our external HiCap or SuperCap power supplies. Even the analogue delights
                            of vinyl are yours to explore: simply add a StageLine or SuperLine phono stage. The SUPERNAIT 2 doesn't miss a trick or a beat. It doesn't miss any music either. The SUPERNAIT 2 is never fazed by the demands of either speaker
                            or music. It simply delivers dynamic, detailed and engaging music that can’t fail to move you.

                    <h3><strong>Schiit Audio</strong></h3>
                    <h5 class="company-info">
                        Who We Are? Schiit got started in 2010 when two audio industry veterans decided it was time to shake things up a bit. The two audiophiles are Jason Stoddard, formerly of Sumo, and Mike Moffat, formerly of Theta. Together, they have designed dozens of
                        audio and A/V products, from the Andromeda III to the Cobalt 307 to the DS Pre and Angstrom 200. So, yeah: fully balanced differential power amplifiers, fully discrete I/V conversion stages, audiophile D/A converters, relay-switched
                        stepped attenuator volume controls in preamps.<br>The first DTS home theater surround processor on the market . . . we’ve done a ton of stuff. So What Now, and Why So Much Headphone Stuff? In the old days,
                        audiophiles went up the food chain from the table radio to the console stereo to separate speakers the size of refrigerators and monoblocks that would cook a cat. Today, nobody starts with a table radio. Everyone—and we mean everyone—starts
                        with headphones. So, yeah. We do a lot of headphone stuff.<br>What makes them special are three things: Unique Multibit DAC and Digital Filter Technologies Today, virtually every DAC uses a reduced-bit technology known as "delta
                        sigma." Multibit DACs have largely gone by the wayside, thanks to less-expensive delta-sigma technology. The few multibit DACs that exist either use NOS (new old stock) D/A chips, one of two or three still-extant multibit chips,
                        or build their own R2R ladders at high cost.<br>We've always believed that multibit DACs provide the best sonic performance, especially when coupled with Schiit's unique, DSP-based closed-form digital filter. This is why we created
                        two entirely new multibit DAC architectures using current-production, medical/military grade D/A converters that have linearity specs far exceeding any audio DAC. If you'd like to learn more, read about Yggdrasil, Gungnir Multibit,
                        or Bifrost Multibit.<br>Innovative Analog Approaches On the analog side, we've also taken innovative approaches, each uniquely designed for the task at hand. Even our least expensive headphone amplifier is essentially a miniature,
                        fully discrete, DC coupled, Lin-topology power amplifier.<br>We've introduced unique output stages to wring more power out of Lyr 2 with its Dynamically Adaptive output, re-introduced inherently balanced topologies like the circlotron
                        in Mjolnir 2, and created unique "analog computer-style" protection systems. For Ragnarok, we introduced the entirely new concept of 100% intelligent microprocessor management of the entire amplifier--from bias to DC level to overcorrect
                        protection...and included a relay-switched stepped attenuator, for perfect channel matching and no ICs in the signal path...and also created an amplifier that's comfortable driving everything, from tiny IEMs to giant speakers.<br>                        Designed for the Real World The real world is a complex place, which is why all of our products are overbuilt. Pick up one of our affordable Valhalla 2 or Lyr 2 amps, and marvel at the weight, heft, and solidity (each of those
                        two amplifiers use two separate transformers with real high-voltage supplies—an approach that's usually far beyond their modest price. Then, we test them extensively with Stanford Research audio analyzers (and our ears), and we
                        burn-in every product from Asgard 2 on up for a minimum of 1 day to help catch any early failures. (Ragnarok and Yggdrasil get 4 days each).<br>We also keep very close tabs on any service and support needs, so you can rest assured
                        of years of great sound. And—it bears mentioning—we believe that close-coupled, local control of all of the aspects of production delivers better products.
                        <br>That's why we design and produce our stuff here in the USA, with the vast majority of parts cost going to US-based companies manufacturing in the US. We need all of that clarification in there because some people have played
                        games with what "Made in USA" means. When we say it, it means that our chassis guys are right over the hill in the San Fernando Valley, our transformers are made here in California, our boards come from the east coast (of the USA),
                        and we design, assemble, and test everything here in Valencia, California. Why don’t you check out our Schiit?

                            a unique end-game headphone amp fully ready for any headphone, from IEMs to the hardest-to-drive planars. Choose Tube Hybrid, Solid-State, or Both Yes, that’s right. You can get Mjolnir 2 as a tube hybrid, or as a pure solid-state
                            amp—or get both, and swap out as you’d like.<br>You can also swap the standard 6BZ7 tubes for anything in the 6DJ8, 6922, ECC88, and 2492 families, to “roll” the sound to your specific preference. Or just opt for the Schiit

                            Mjolnir uses our exclusive, inherently balanced and differential Crossfet topology—the only circlotron-style topology in a headphone amplifier (well, except for Ragnarok.) It’s balanced in and balanced out, with a custom 4-gang
                            RK27 Alps volume pot—providing end-game performance for a mid-level price.<br>5-Year Warranty, 15-Day Satisfaction Guarantee Mjolnir is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years.
                            Yes. FIVE. Compare that to the competition. Don’t like Mjolnir? No problem. You can send it back for a full refund, minus 5% transaction fee, within 15 days of receiving your amp.

                        <p>
                            Ragnarok is the first truly universal amplifier, fully capable of powering everything from IEMs to loudspeakers. With up to 100 watts per channel into 4 ohms, 3 selectable gains, a sophisticated relay-switched stepped attenuator volume control, complete
                            microprocessor management of all operational points, including bias and DC offset, and Schiit’s Crossfet™ circlotron-style output topology, Ragnarok completely befits its name—in Norse legend, Ragnarok was the “end of the world.”
                            From IEMs to Loudspeakers<br>Go ahead. Plug in your sensitive headphones and set Ragnarok’s gain to 1. You’ll enjoy a silent background, and the fine control that a 64-step attenuator can provide.
                            Or run it with the most power-hungry orthos you know. With gain set at 20, and 15W RMS into 32 ohms, you’re ready for an amazing performance. Speakers? No problem. With 60W per channel into 8 ohms, Ragnarok delivers amazing
                            performance with most popular speakers.<br> A Complete Integrated Amp<br> Ragnarok includes 5 relay-switched inputs—two balanced and three single-ended, as well as balanced and single-ended preamp outputs for use as a preamp.
                            For outputs, both balanced and single-ended outputs are provided for headphones, and balanced speaker terminal outputs for loudspeakers. Nothing In the Signal Path Except Signal Ragnarok is an "intelligent" amplifier, using
                            a microprocessor to oversee every aspect of its operation—from quiescent bias, to DC offset, to complete fault protection. It’s also designed so that any major problem mutes all the outputs and reverts the amp to its low-gain,
                            zero volume mode. This means we can dispense with coupling caps and DC servos entirely, for a gain stage that has nothing in the signal path—except for your music.<br> Made in USA By “made in USA,” we mean made in USA. Ragnarok
                            is built to order in Valencia, CA, by our most experienced assemblers, subjected to a rigorous series of both instrumented and listening tests, and burnt in for 100+ hours before being re-tested and shipped. As with all of
                            our products, the vast majority of the total production cost of Ragnarok—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our board house is 20 minutes away from our office in Newhall.
                            Our chassis guys are just over the hill in the Valley. 5-Year Warranty Ragnarok is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years. Yes. FIVE. Which is up to 5X that of our competition,
                            if you weren’t so hot at math. Note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.” 15-Day Satisfaction Guarantee Try Ragnarok in your own house for 15 days. If you don’t like it, simply send it back for a refund, minus a 5% transaction
                            fee. Try spending 15 days in an audio store. They’ll kick you out. Unless you buy them donuts. Maybe.

                                Multibit or delta-sigma? Yes. With Gungnir, you have the flexibility to choose between affordable delta-sigma performance, or Schiit’s own proprietary multibit architecture with closed-form digital filter. Both versions offer excellent performance for
                                a moderate price—as well as the comfort of completely upgradable, modular design.
                                <br>Gungnir: Formidable Performance. Choose Gungnir, and you get a truly hardware-balanced DAC with two AKM AK4399 32-bit D/A converters, followed by a fully discrete, JFET-input stage for current gain and filtering. The
                                result is exceptional performance for the price—frequently lauded by the press as the best in its price class. Gungnir Multibit: Above and Beyond<br> Choose Gungnir Multibit, and you get the same proprietary closed-form
                                DSP-based digital filter as Yggdrasil, coupled to four precision Analog Devices AD5781BRUZ digital to analog converters for true hardware balancing and 19 effective bits of resolution. The analog section is completed with
                                discrete JFET buffers and summers, the same as Yggdrasil. Adapticlock™: Unique Clock Analysis and Regeneration Both versions of Gungnir include our proprietary Adapticlock system, which provides for both exceptional jitter
                                performance and rock-solid, glitch-free connectivity. Adapticlock analyzes the incoming signal quality and automatically routes it to the best clock regeneration system—either VCXO or VCO-based. And, it does all of this
                                without altering the bit depth or sample rate of your original music. Forget decrapifiers, regenerators, isolators, and all the USB dongles and boxes you’ve been told you need for USB sound. Our all-new Gen 5 USB input
                                doesn’t require any of that stuff. It’s this simple: Gen 5 is USB, solved. Now standard on all our upgradable DACs, Gen 5 USB features full galvanic isolation via transformers, self-power for low noise and latching, and
                                high-quality local clocking for both 44.1 and 48k multiples.<br> 5-Year Warranty - Gungnir is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years. Yes. FIVE. Which is up to 5X that of
                                our competition, if you weren’t so hot at math. Note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.”<br> 15-Day Satisfaction Guarantee - Try Gungnir in your own house for 15 days. If you don’t like it, simply send it back for a refund,
                                minus a 5% transaction fee. Try spending 15 days in an audio store. They’ll kick you out. Unless you buy them donuts. Maybe.

                    <div class="info">
                        <p>
                            Forget everything you know about DACs. Yggdrasil is the world’s only closed-form multibit DAC, delivering 21 bits of resolution with no guessing anywhere in the digital or analog path. We’ve thrown out delta-sigma D/As and traditional digital filters
                            to preserve the original samples all the way through from input to output. Let’s take a closer look:<br> Closed-Form Digital Filter Preserves Original Samples Most DACs simply use the stoc Mission-Critical
                            D/A Tech, Discrete Class A Analog 2 Output For MRI diagnoses, doctors don’t rely on the guesswork of “24 bit” or “32 bit” delta-sigma D/A converters. Instead, they choose the bit-perfect imaging of precision multibit DACs,
                            like the Analog Devices AD5791. We chose this same critical technology for Yggdrasil. Now in Analog 2 form (shipping since late 2017), we’ve combined the output of four of these DACs with DC-coupled, low-noise, Class A JFET
                            buffers and summers with high current output capability to drive long cable runs and low-impedance line inputs, such as 600 ohm professional gear.<br> Adapticlock and USB Gen 5: Advanced Input Optimization Yggdrasil accepts
                            up to 5 digital inputs and carefully manages them with our Adapticlock™ clock regeneration system. Adapticlock is the most sophisticated clock management system in the world. It assesses the quality of all inputs, measures
                            their incoming center frequency and jitter, and automatically routes the input to the best clock regeneration system. And, our Gen 5 USB features full galvanic isolation via transformers, self-power for low-noise and latching
                            sections, and high-quality local clocking for both 44.1 and 48k multiples. (And, if you don’t understand the technobabble, here’s the bottom line: it works and sounds great.) Made in USA By “made in USA,” we mean made in USA.
                            The vast majority of the total production cost of Yggdrasil—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our board house is 20 minutes away from our office in Newhall. Our chassis
                            guys are just over the hill in the Valley. 5-Year Warranty Yggdrasil is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years. Yes. FIVE. Which is up to 5X that of our competition, if you
